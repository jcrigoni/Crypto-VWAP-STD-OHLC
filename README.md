Crypto VWAP & OHLC Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a Python-based analysis tool for cryptocurrency trading data. It focuses on calculating the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and analyzing Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) price statistics.

ðŸš€ Features

Fetch cryptocurrency data using an API

Compute VWAP for market trend analysis

Generate OHLC statistics

Standard deviation calculations for price volatility

Data visualization for insights

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed along with the required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib requests

Running the Notebook

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/jcrigoni/Crypto-VWAP-STD-OHLC.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd Crypto-VWAP-STD-OHLC

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Projet_Python_Rodner_Rigoni.ipynb

ðŸ“Š Methodology

Data Retrieval: Fetching live or historical cryptocurrency price data.

VWAP Calculation: Computing VWAP to analyze market trends.

OHLC Analysis: Studying Open, High, Low, and Close price movements.

Standard Deviation: Measuring volatility to assess market risk.

Visualization: Plotting price trends for better insights.

ðŸ“Œ Example Code Snippet

import pandas as pd

def calculate_vwap(df):
    df['VWAP'] = (df['Close'] * df['Volume']).cumsum() / df['Volume'].cumsum()
    return df
